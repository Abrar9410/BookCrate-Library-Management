# ðŸ“š BookCrate Library Management System

BookCrate is a minimalist Library Management System built using **React**, **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**, and **TypeScript**. The system is designed to demonstrate clean architecture, RESTful API integration, and responsive UI design for managing books and borrowingsâ€”**without the complexity of user authentication or payment systems**.

## Features

### Public Access
All routes are open and do not require authentication, allowing users to manage and interact with books freely.

### Book Management

- **Book List Table**  
  View all books in a responsive table layout with the following columns:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Genre
  - ISBN
  - Copies
  - Availability
  - Actions (Edit | Delete | Borrow)

- **Add New Book**  
  - Accessed via `/create-book`
  - Form fields include: Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Description, Copies
  - Automatically marked as available unless copies = 0
  - Redirects to book list upon successful submission

- **Edit Book**  
  - Accessed via `/edit-book/:id`
  - Updates existing book info and reflects changes immediately

- **Delete Book**  
  - Opens a confirmation modal before deleting
  - Removes the book and updates the UI upon confirmation

- **Borrow Book**  
  - Accessed via `/borrow/:bookId`
  - Fields: Quantity, Due Date
  - Borrow logic:
    - Quantity cannot exceed available copies
    - If copies reach 0, the book is marked as unavailable
  - On success, redirects to `/borrow-summary`
